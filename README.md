> üèô Convert URLs to images using headless Chrome, [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer), & Docker

## The Problem

I often need to investigate suspicious URLs/hyperlinks, but visiting them directly from my machine could lead to compromise (e.g. malware infections, drive-by downloads ...etc).

I could potentially visit the suspicious resources inside virtual machines, but this method seems slow, clunky, and bloated for this particular use-case.

## This Solution

This project, inspired by [similar ones](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/url-to-image), relies on a [small javascript](index.js) file to interface with [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

In simple terms, `chrome-snapper` uses headless Chrome in a Docker container to visit any URL supplied by the user, take a full-page screenshot of the rendered URL. Any malware or drive-by downloads vanish along with the container when it terminates.

## Usage

```sh
$ docker build -t chrome-snapper -f Dockerfile . # build the image
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/screenshot chrome-snapper <URL>
```
